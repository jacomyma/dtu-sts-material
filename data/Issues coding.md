# Issue 1: Are investments in energy islands a good way to stimulate innovation and economic growth?

The hope is that energy islands will boost local and national economic growth. They will require technological innovation, which may have future commercial potential, and their construction could create local jobs. Whether this will happen is subject to discussion. Additionally, if the objective is to stimulate economic growth, the question is also whether there are better ways to invest the money. It has been argued that the projects entail several financial risks, including uncertainty about how energy markets will develop, and that they depend on technological innovations that have yet to materialize.


# Issue 2: Are energy islands the most cost-effective way to reach carbon emission targets? 

Cost-efficiency is a frequent argument to be found in arguments supporting energy islands as a valid solution. Yet, some actors question the premises on which the cost-efficiency is assessed. These actors often go on to argue that there are cheaper and existing alternatives to reach net zero goals. Such suggested alternatives include nuclear, combinations of onshore wind and solar, carbon capture and storage, or reducing consumption.


# Issue 3: Is bureaucracy slowing down the energy island projects?

Stifling bureaucratic processes are sometimes cited as a challenge. Uncoordinated and lengthy approval processes, lack of transparency, especially in a complicated tender, are seen as causing delays. How do we balance the need to ensure transparency and fairness with the urgency of achieving emission targets?


# Issue 4: What will the implications be of a new bidding zone for the electricity market?

Danmark has traditionally been divided by the Great Belt into two bidding zones where electricity is traded - DK1 & DK2. Particularly for Bornholm Energy Island it was decided in 2023 to establish a new bidding zone - DK3 – to amend anticipated structural congestion. This comes with cross-border challenges and concerns about impact on price convergence and local energy prices on Bornholm.


# Issue 5: Will we have a stable energy supply?

While energy islands are enshrined in Danish law as a key component in the green energy transition, there are concerns about the reliability of a system heavily dependent on intermittent renewable sources like wind. These concerns are related to the need for backup power, energy storage solutions, and the overall security of supply.


# Issue 6: Will the European countries manage to cooperate around offshore energy hubs?

European energy cooperation has always been important but for the energy island projects this cooperation would have to be expanded. Since the islands are shared infrastructure, discussions ensue about shared costs, motivated by shared efforts to reach the European emissions targets, strategic alignment, and shared innovation.


# Issue 7: Geopolitics and energy independence: Will the energy islands make our energy system more resilient or mor
fragile?',
Geopolitical tensions have revitalized discussions about European energy independence. Energy islands are on the one hand championed as a way to increase energy independence by reducing reliance on for example Russian oil and gas. In this context, technologies for energy storage and regional cooperation around energy hubs are often seen as key. However, the centralized infrastructure and increased interdependence that comes with it also raise vulnerability concerns.


# Issue 8: How to finance the energy islands?

This issue revolves around the high costs associated with the projects, how these costs should be covered and by whom. There are several aspects to the discussion, for example questions about public versus private funding, questions about the high initial costs, questions about the role of the state and how much risk it should carry, and questions about the market viability of the projects.


# Issue 9: Is nuclear power an alternative to energy islands?

Several actors argue that nuclear power could be a more cost-effective alternative because it offers a stable energy supply regardless of weather conditions. While nuclear is often criticized for its lengthy construction times and associated costs, energy island projects have faced similar criticism. You could therefore argue that the Danish ban on nuclear power should be lifted to explore it as a future alternative. From that proposition ensues a range of claims and counterclaims about the safety and location of nuclear power plants, including technological advancements to improve safety and handling of nuclear waste.


# Issue 10: How will energy islands impact the marine environment?

The concern here is that the construction of offshore infrastructure can lead to significant seabed disturbance, destroying fish habitats and leading to biodiversity loss. Foundation excavation and cable laying could also increase the concentration of suspended sediment in the water, which can displace fish that rely on vision for hunting and feeding. There are concerns that the noise and vibrations caused by construction and maintenance activities might disturb marine life. On the other hand, the foundations of wind turbines and energy islands could also act as artificial reefs, potentially fostering new, diverse habitats for fish, seals, birds, and other marine life. All of these discussions take place in a context where full environmental impact assessments are not yet available.


# Issue 11: How will energy islands impact local communities?

On Bornholm, concerns include that the energy island projects may lead to the expropriation and demolition of homes, displacing residents and impacting local economies, landscapes and cultural heritage without locals being properly consulted or compensated. In other instances, the economic benefits of the construction are positively discussed, although it is also questioned whether the projects will have lasting economic benefits for the local communities beyond the construction phase.


# Issue 12: What are the current envisioned ideas of interplay between Power-to-X and energy islands?

Power-to-X technologies are frequently discussed in relation to energy islands because they are seen as crucial for maximizing the potential of renewable energy sources and addressing some of their inherent challenges, particularly energy storage in times of overproduction and also as a tool for ensuring grid stability. Political initiatives and the recent launch of the Kassø PtX plant have supported hopes in these ambitions, but many things remain unresolved including the high costs of PtX facilities and energy loss in the conversion process.


# Issue 13: From cyber to sabotage - are energy islands a security risk?

Energy islands are critical infrastructure and have over time raised more and more security concerns. Cybersecurity is for example an issue because of the digital control technologies that support that support them, and the undersea cable infrastructure could make them vulnerable to sabotage. A hub thus provides a high value target.


# Issue 14: How sustainable are the building materials for the energy islands?

The construction of energy islands requires substantial amounts of building materials like steel, concrete, and copper. Some question whether the use of these materials is sustainable, due to the way they are sourced and the emissions associated with their production and transportation.


# Issue 15: How can High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology be integrated into the electricity system?

HVDC is a crucial technology for the energy islands. However, it is well known that the integration of HVAC and HVDC technologies presents complex technical challenges and that HVDC does not allow for the transmission of VAR (Variable Ampere Reactive) power, meaning there is no voltage support at the reception end. Particularly multi-terminal HVDC solutions raise questions. There is a lack of developed standards, it is seen by some as a new and risky technology, which leads to concerns about cost. HVDC circuit breakers scaled to energy islands capacities are indispensable and will need to be developed.


# Issue 16: Are the energy islands socially and economically just?

Who will gain and who will bear the burdens of realizing the energy islands? These discussions revolve around the distribution of benefits, financial burdens, and the overall impact on society. Will the energy islands generate a net socio-economic benefit? To what extent should taxpayers bear the burden? Will the projects create jobs and for whom? Will the local communities be properly involved? Is there some form of co-ownership and how can you ensure social acceptance?'
